Ive just submitted my first coding project with Flatiron School and feel great knowing i can make something from nothing. The resources provided were extremely helpful in setting up my enviornment and walking me through the early phase of the project which is where i tend to struggle the most. I also ran into some debugging issues towards the end with display the right information upon user input, but after a few study sessions with Flatiron instructors i was able to work them out. Im very excited to increase my coding skills and take on bigger and more difficult projects!
