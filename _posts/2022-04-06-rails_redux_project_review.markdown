My final project with Flatiron has been submitted for review today. I am extremely excited to test my knowledge on React and Redux with a Flatiron instructor. its has been challenging for me to absorb the new concepts introduced in the last module, however Rails ability to separate concerns using components has been a great step foreword in my skillset as programmer. I will eagerly continue to prepare for my final project review, a pass on this final review will mean completion of the course and graduation from Flatiron bootcamp!
