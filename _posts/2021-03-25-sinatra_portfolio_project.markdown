Today i'm submitting my Sinatra Project for instructor review. I've implemented all the functionality required by the project and am very excited to go over it with a Flatiron Lead. I was able to complete it in the time frame i gave myself (1 week). My confidence as a Software Engineer is increasing as i am able to see better and more complicated applcation of my skills. As i move on to the Rails section I look foreward to new challanges and better apps.
