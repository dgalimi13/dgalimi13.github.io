Today i'll be submitting my rails project for review. It seems to fulfil all the requirements and im eager to get it reviewed by a Flation coach. This project was a bit more difficult, specifically the Omniauth third party login. I found the study groups on flatiron to be extreamly useful in pointing me in the right direction to be able to get it working properly. i look foreward to the next section which deals with more front-end functionality as i feel my skills in that area could improve. i will continue to review the Rails section to ensure i am sufficiently prepared for my review.
