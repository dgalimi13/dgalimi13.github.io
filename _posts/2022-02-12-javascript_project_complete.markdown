I've just submitted my fourth flatiron project for instructor review. i feels great to have a working application ready for assessment. JavaScript has been a challenge to learn, specifically how it utilizes functions and deals with scope issues. Creating a rails backend without views was also unfamiliar to me. However, after seeing the power of JavaScript and its ability to manipulate the DOM i feel I've added a valuable tool to my coding abilities. I will continue to prepare for my project review and look forward to beginning the final chapter of my flatiron course!
